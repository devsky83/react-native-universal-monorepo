# React Native Universal Monorepo (ðŸš§ WIP)

A React Native monorepo boilerplate supporting multiple platforms: Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, web, browser extension, Electron.

## Overview

This monorepo uses [Yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to support a modular React Native project.

It uses Yarn's `nohoist` to ensure the `react-native` libraries are stored within the workspace packages instead of being hosted to the top level.  
On one hand, this approach has the drawback of (potentially) keeping multiple copies of the same React Native version in different workspace packages.  
On the other hand, we get a predictable React Native setup: we don't have to deal with changing root directory references in the native code, and we can support different versions of React Native while still sharing the app's code.

> Please notice that I'm not saying that this is not the _right_ way to do React Native monorepos. It's just an approach that I enjoy using.

## Supported platforms

- Android (React-Native 0.65)
- iOS (React-Native 0.65)
- Windows (React-Native 0.65)
- MacOS (React-Native 0.63)
- Web (React-Native 0.65)
- Web - Browser Extension (React-Native 0.65)
- Web - Electron (React-Native 0.65)

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository: `git@github.com:mmazzarolo/react-native-universal-monorepo.git`
2. Run yarn install `cd react-native-universal-monorepo && yarn`


> ðŸš§ I'm working on a blog post to explain how to get to this monorepo structure from scratch.

## Native dependencies

For some native (or React-Native-specific) dependencies, you'll need to `nohoist` them and/or update the metro configuration to avoid collisions with multiple versions of them.  
This is not an issue with the approach used in this project per se', it's a common problem with monorepos.  
You can use [`babel-plugin-module-resolver`](https://github.com/tleunen/babel-plugin-module-resolver) to dedupe these dependencies â€” planning to add an example soon.
